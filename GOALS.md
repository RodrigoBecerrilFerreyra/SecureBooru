1. Be as lightweight as possible.
    - Things like discussion forums and comments can be forgone as discussion
    can happen elsewhere. 
    - List of things I want to include:
        - Tag listing (IMPORTANT)
        - Pool system (IMPORTANT)
        - Tag wiki (low importance)
        - Notes (low importance, for translations)
        - Parent/sibling structure
        - Rating system
    - List of things I want to exclude:
        - Comments
        - Tag/wiki forums
    - This is a simple project, so it shouldn't take too many resources when running.
