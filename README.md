# SecureBooru

## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a
[booru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard#Danbooru-style_boards)
(a collection of images with a tagging system and a search feature) that is
relatively worry-free for the person hosting it. The idea is to create a booru
where any Internet user can freely upload images and contribute to tagging them,
while the host doesn't have to worry about hosting unwanted content on his or
her storage. To upload an image, a user provides a live link to the image. The
image is not saved onto host storage until it is approved by a moderator,
meaning content will never touch storage if it is unapproved.
