# SecureBooru

## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a
[booru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard#Danbooru-style_boards)
(a collection of images with a tagging system and a search feature) API that is
simple and feature-rich. Using this API, one can make a website, mobile app, or
booru scraper to view and download images. This booru API supports tagging, tag
namespaces, authentication, and more, all in a lightweight package.
